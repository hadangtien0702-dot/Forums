# Age Calculator Module

This module provides a tool for insurance agents to calculate a client's age based on two metrics:

1.  **Actual Age**: The client's chronological age.
2.  **Insurance Age**: The age used for insurance policy purposes, which typically increases six months after the client's birthday.

## Features

-   Calculates both actual and insurance age from a given date of birth.
-   Displays the date of the next "age-up" for insurance purposes.
-   Shows the number of days remaining until the next age-up, highlighting urgent cases.
-   Maintains a history of recent calculations for quick reference.
